<p>To verify your {{forum_name}} forum identity so that you can use the companion site, you must prove that you control an account on the forums. This can be done automatically using the form below{% if user.member %}, but if you prefer, you can also have your identity verified manually by contacting an admin from your forum account{% endif %}.</p>

<p>You can verify your identity automatically by editing the "About you" section on your user profile to contain a verification code unique to your companion app user account. Your verification code is <strong>{{user.verification_code}}</strong>. To verify yourself, simply perform the following steps:</p>

{% include "verification_instructions.html" %}

<form action="" method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{% include "form.html" %}
<p><button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Verify me!</button></p>
</form>
{% endif %}
